# Stat447C Group Project: Bayesian Survival Analysis of Water Scarcity

This project performs a Bayesian survival analysis to model the time until countries reach high water scarcity levels, using data from the Kaggle "Global Water Consumption Dataset (2000-2024)". The analysis uses a hierarchical Weibull model implemented in Stan to account for regional variations and time-varying covariates.

## Files

*   `cleaned_global_water_consumption.csv`: The input dataset.
*   `data_prep.R`: Loads the raw data, defines the survival outcome (time to first "High" scarcity level using the original categories), handles time-varying covariates, adds continental grouping, and saves the processed data (`processed_water_survival_data.rds`).
*   `eda.R`: Generates exploratory plots (histograms, boxplots using original data; Kaplan-Meier curves using processed survival summary) and saves them as PNG files.
*   `weibull_hierarchical_tvc.stan`: Stan model file defining the hierarchical Weibull survival model with time-varying covariates, using a piecewise exponential likelihood formulation.
*   `stan_model.R`: Loads processed data, scales covariates, prepares the data list, compiles and runs the Stan model, and saves the fit object (`stan_weibull_fit.rds`).
*   `processed_water_survival_data.rds`: Intermediate file. Output of `data_prep.R`, containing the data ready for modeling.
*   `stan_weibull_fit.rds`: Output of `stan_model.R`, containing the MCMC samples from the Bayesian model fit. Analysis of this object forms the basis of the results.
*   `*.png`: Output plots generated by `eda.R`.

## Workflow

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure R is installed with required packages (`tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `survival`, `survminer`, `patchwork`, `cmdstanr`, `posterior`) and `cmdstanr` is configured.
2.  **Data Prep:** Run `Rscript data_prep.R` to generate `processed_water_survival_data.rds`.
3.  **EDA:** Run `Rscript eda.R` to generate PNG plots for review.
4.  **Stan Model:** Run `Rscript stan_model.R` to compile and run the sampler (may take several minutes), creating `stan_weibull_fit.rds`.
5.  **Analysis:** Load `stan_weibull_fit.rds` in R for posterior analysis, diagnostics checks, and generating report results.
